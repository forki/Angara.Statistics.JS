Angara.Statistics translated with WebSharper
=================

Open and build Angara.Statistics.JS.sln


Caution!
The code is partially rewritten to satisfy WebSharper capabilities and is not yet fully tested!


For now the following functions are tranlated and can be used from JavaScript:
    *   Statistics.kde - Gaussian kernel density estimator for one-dimensional data
    *   Statistics.kde2
    *   Statistics.ridders - Root of a function using Ridders method
    *   Statistics.dct - Descrete cosine transform
    *   Statistics.idct - Inverse discrete cosine transform
    *   Statistics.fft - Fast Fourier transform
    *   Statistics.ifft - Inverse Fast Fourier Transform
